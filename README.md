# Conway's Game of Life

This project is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life built with a custom C# renderer. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway, where cells on a grid live, die, or reproduce based on a set of simple rules.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Users can start the game by seeding initial cells on the grid and pressing **Enter** to begin.
- **Real-Time Updates:** The grid updates in real-time, displaying the next generation of cells based on Conway's rules.
- **Pause and Modify:** Press **Esc** to pause the game, allowing you to add new cells to the grid before resuming.
  
## Controls
- **Enter**: Start or resume the game.
- **Esc**: Pause the game and enable cell editing.
  
## How to Play
1. Seed cells by selecting points on the grid.
2. Press **Enter** to start the game.
3. To pause and add new cells, press **Esc**.
4. Once paused, you can add more cells before pressing **Enter** to resume.
5. Grid can be cleared by pressing **C**.
6. Grid can be modified in the **WindowSeedFactor** File.
